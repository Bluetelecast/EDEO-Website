    <p className="p-1 mt-3 text-md">
    The EDEO’s other focus areas are the Afghanistan sustainable development 
    program and welfare for the rural and urban areas of the country and creating
     job opportunities by working against paid internship programs. Through the development
      of education and vocational programs in Afghan society, EDEO aims to help young girls 
      and women in the capital and rural areas of provinces of the country, as well as to 
      empower girls, women, and boys to work on the ground. 
      </p>
      <p className="p-1 mt-3 text-md">Our commitment is to remove poverty 
      from society and humanity, establish women's rights, equality, and unity, to play a strong
       role in rebuilding and developing Afghanistan. We give a hand-up rather than a hand-out,
        helping women earn an income through vocational training, equipment, community loans, 
        capacity building, and value-adding partnerships, a Fair Chance for Women and Girls in 
        Rural Communities. Women and girls are more likely to live in poverty, have limited access
         to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, and face gender-based violence and 
         discrimination, when women and girls have a fair chance and equal access to resources, 
         they are better 
    able to contribute to the economic, social, and political life of their communities.
    </p>
    <p className="p-1 mt-3 text-md">
    We are here to address gender inequality by providing greater access to education, healthcare resources; vocational training that enables her to become self-sustainable, community gender equality training, self-help groups, and more.

By empowering children, youth, girls, and women through education,
 we empower entire communities, fostering social mobility, reducing inequality,
  and creating a pathway to prosperity for future generations. 
  We serve by addressing the issues at hand and are driven so that all programs
   and initiatives become embedded in the communities and deliver long-term benefits.

Helping communities thrive to improve livelihood in rural communities is 
vital for alleviating poverty and achieving holistic development.
 Livelihood enhancement initiative creates economic opportunities 
 that uplift individuals and families out of poverty. As households 
 experience improved livelihoods, they can invest in better health and 
 education for their children, breaking the cycle of intergenerational
  poverty and improving their well-being. Moreover, enhanced livelihoods empower women,
 leading to greater gender equality and women’s economic empowerment.
