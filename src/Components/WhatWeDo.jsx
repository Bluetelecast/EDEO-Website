    EDEO believes: “Education is the key to success for any individual, society and a nation as a whole. Education is the best tool to combat against all forms of inequalities and injustices in any society. The lack of education is considered as one of the major reasons behind four and half decades’ of sufferings in Afghanistan. Education is instrumental in promoting women’s’ status and eliminating harmful cultural practices and illiteracy programs that impede women to acquire knowledge on matters related to their empowerment. Moreover, their insufficient knowledge and know how make them vulnerable and put them at risks and problems. An experience show that more the education increases, the more life enlightens and the more living conditions of women improve and get better.

Taking this opportunity, EDEO will conduct training for Gender Equality, fundamentals of Islamic pillars, awareness of six core principles of Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and codes of conduct, Basic children rights in Islam, Orphans’ rights and Prevention of Workplace Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Abuse of Authority in the Workplace.
