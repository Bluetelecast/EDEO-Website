What We Do
Education & Capacity Building Programs welfare:

EDEO believes: “Education is the key to success for any individual, society and a nation as a whole. Education is the best tool to combat against all forms of inequalities and injustices in any society. The lack of education is considered as one of the major reasons behind four and half decades’ of sufferings in Afghanistan. Education is instrumental in promoting women’s’ status and eliminating harmful cultural practices and illiteracy programs that impede women to acquire knowledge on matters related to their empowerment. Moreover, their insufficient knowledge and know how make them vulnerable and put them at risks and problems. An experience show that more the education increases, the more life enlightens and the more living conditions of women improve and get better.
Human Rights Promotion

Means to address the women right education from different perspectives, EDEO established a Human rights & documentation mechanism that performs several activities such as the documentation of human rights abuse afflicted on Women, children and affected relatives.
Combating all forms of violence

EDEO believes that, in order to prevent violence, communities must be strengthened. It is through preventive steps such as awareness, outreach activities and information sharing that EDEO is able to provide survivors of gender based violence with adequate service and support. In this context, EDEO, will carry out social awareness campaigns on important days such as March 8th International Women's Day and November 25th Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and EDEO will see these campaigns as an opportunity for social transformation.

Women Rights Advocacy and Access to Equal Opportunities for Women

Afghan women have suffered considerably in the past several decades. The continuous conflict in the country, poor perceptions of traditional constraints, and local norms, misinterpretation of the Islamic teachings to the uneducated communities, and its imposition on the people of the country are believed to be the major causes behind the rollback in maintaining women's rights. EDEO will continue its usual support to women and gender equality, both from the Islamic context and perception and Afghan traditional norms. Taking this opportunity, EDEO will conduct training for Gender Equality, fundamentals of Islamic pillars, awareness of six core principles of Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and codes of conduct, Basic children rights in Islam, Orphans’ rights and Prevention of Workplace Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Abuse of Authority in the Workplace.
